# LuigiBlox
A modification of the Roblox 2008 Client to replace the character and character sounds to Luigi from Super Mario Bros.

## Installation
Head over to https://github.com/Thomasluigi07/LuigiBlox/releases/ to install it. Ensure that vcredist_x86 (Microsoft Visual C++ 2005) is installed first before installing the "LuigiBlox" zip file.

## How do I play it?
Open any roblox place compatible with the <2008 clients, then press Tools > Execute Script, now find the "PlaySolo.lua" file and use it. You should be playing your place now.

## HELP! LUIGI IS INVISIBLE!
He is coming for your immediate location. Start running.
No no, I'm joking. Make sure you download it from the Releases, not the main page.

## HELP! LUIGIBLOX THROWS AN ERROR AT ME WHEN I START IT!
